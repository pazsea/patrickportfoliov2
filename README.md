# **My Portfolio website.**
This page is made in React JS. It was my first try doing anything in React. I fell in love with the programming. If you look at my code, I tried to make some stuff combining props, states and more with "normal" JS functions like map. I think I made some cool solutions.
<p> For a <a href="http://www.patricksjobergportfolio.se" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> </p>

### My functions
* My portfolio sections has object sent down with props to the cards component. There it will create an css "card" for that project. Check it out. It starts in index.js and down with props to cards.js.
* I also have an Backdrop component that is totally reusable wherever you want.
